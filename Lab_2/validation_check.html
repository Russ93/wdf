		<h1> Site Validation </h1>
		<div>
        	<h2><a href="http://www.pandora.com/">Pandora &copy;</a></h2>
				<p><em>Pandora is an Internet radio that has thousands of users everyday.</em>
                <br />Pandora Radio failed the validation check because the site has many tags
                that should be self closing tags left unclosed.
                <br /> -ie. &lt;br /&gt; instead of &lt;br&gt;, &lt;img /&gt; instead of &lt;img&gt;, or &lt;input /&gt; instead of &lt;input&gt;
                </p>
        </div>

				<h2><a href="http://thenounproject.com/">The Noun Project &copy;</a></strong></h2>
      			<p><em>The noun project is a site that helps you find 
      				icons to go along with an action</em>
    				<br />The Noun Project passed the validation test and has no HTML problem.

		<div>
				<h2><a href="http://www.google.com/">Google &copy;</a></strong></h2>
      			<p><em>Google and a world know search engine</em>
    				<br />Google problem is it didn't close this tag
    				&lt;=a&&(a=_gjwl.href.substring(a),0)
    				<br />They should finish the string and close the tag
      			</p>

      	<div>
				<h2><a href="http://www.safehousemovement.com/">Safe House Movement &copy;</a></strong></h2>
      			<p><em>Safe house movement is a website that helps gather donations for a
      				charity that helps house orphans in south america</em>
    				<br />Safe House movement has script that is written like HTML
    				<br />Remove the &gl; in the javascript to the browser doesn't think that
    				it's closing something
